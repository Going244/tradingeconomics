 GDP Comparison Project

This project is a Flask web application that allows users to compare the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) of two different countries. Users can select the country name from a dropdown menu, and the application will fetch the GDP data for the selected country. The GDP data is then displayed in the form of a table and a chart, allowing users to visually compare the GDP trends of the two countries.ï¿¼Enter
